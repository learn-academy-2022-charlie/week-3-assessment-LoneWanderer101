# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer: In JavaScript, 'this' is a keyword that refers to objects. 

  Researched answer: I learned that `this` in JavaScript behaves differently than it does in other programming languages. In JavaScript, `this` refers to an object. Which object depends on how this is being invoked. In an object method, `this` refers to the object. By itself, 'this' refers to the global object. In a function, `this` refers to the global object. In a function, in strict mode, `this` is undefined. In an event, `this` refers to the element that received the event.


2. What is React? Why would you use it? 

  Your answer: React was created by Facebook and is used to create web pages and mobile apps.

  Researched answer: React is the most popular front-end application for creating Web applications, used by most fortune 500 companies. Companies use React because it allows them to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page. The main purpose of React is to be fast, scalable, and simple. 


3. Which lifecycle method is required in a React class component?

  Your answer: I don't recall but i will reserach lifecycle methods.

  Researched answer: Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases. The three phases are: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting. The first rendering of the component in the DOM is called “mounting”, while the removal is called “unmounting”. Anything that happens in between (mounting and unmounting) are state updates.


4. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

  Your answer: JSX stands for JavaScript syntax extension and it allows us to write HTML in react. 
 
  Researched answer: JSX is vaster than regular JavaScript and it makes it easier to write or add HTML in React. It can convert HTML tags to react elements. Since JSX is an expression, it can be used inside of if statements and for loops.


5. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

  Your answer: yarn is a package manager for JS.

  Researched answer:  Yarn is a JavaScript package manager that creates the file structure of a React app and manages the dependencies.


6. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

  Your answer: An anonymous function in JavaScript does not have a name.

  Researched answer: Anonymous Function is a function that does not have any name associated with it. Normally we use the function keyword before the function name to define a function in JavaScript. However, in anonymous functions, we use only the function keyword without the function name.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Conditional rendering: Conditional rendering allows you to render different React components or elements if a condition is met. 

2. Object-oriented programming: Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior. OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained. 

3. Ruby: Ruby is an open source, object-oriented programming language created by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in the early 1990s. Ruby has a reputation for simplicity and a style that is both easy to read and write. Ruby is a general-purpose, interpreted, dynamically-typed, server-side scripting language. Ruby has many helpful built in methods and great documentation

4. Ruby blocks: Ruby has anonymous functions similar to JavaScript. They are called blocks. Blocks can be created with the do/end keywords OR with {}. Blocks are code that is passed to a method.

5. Ruby hashes: A hash is a collection of unique keys and their values. A hash is a bit like an array but instead of the values being referenced by an index, the values are reference by their unique key. The class Hash falls under the category of enumerable, which means you can use iterable methods on a hash.
